# GDP-Healthcare-Analysis

# 📌 Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between GDP growth and healthcare spending across different regions using World Bank Open Data. By leveraging Google Cloud Platform (GCP), BigQuery, and Python, the study uncovers trends, correlations, and disparities in economic performance and healthcare investment over a two-decade period.

# 🏆 Key Features

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Ensured data consistency and removed null values.
- Cloud-Based Analysis: Used Google Cloud Storage & BigQuery for scalable data processing.
- Statistical & Correlation Analysis: Investigated year-wise trends and regional disparities.
- Visualization & Insights: Created scatter plots, time-series graphs, and heatmaps to illustrate key findings.

# 📚 Technologies & Tools Used

- Cloud Platforms: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), BigQuery
- Data Processing: SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Storage & Workflow: Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

# 💡 Key Insights

- Moderate Negative Correlation: A correlation of -0.43 between GDP and healthcare spending, meaning higher GDP does not always lead to increased healthcare investment.
- Yearly Variability: Significant deviations were observed in 2008 (financial crisis) and 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic).
- Regional Trends in North America: Highest GDP & healthcare spending.
- Regional Trends in Asia: Lower healthcare investment relative to economic capacity.
- Global Patterns: Economic downturns influence healthcare budgets.
